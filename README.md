# kaggle-titanic

This was my second Kaggle completition. It is a classification competition on predicting which passengers survived
the sinking of the Titanic. Initial data exploration and model experimentation was done in the dataset_exploration.ipynb notebook.
The data exploration showed that Ticket, Cabin, and Name could be ignored. Random Forests and XGBoost performed the best on intial 
testing and were then used as the basis for subsequent models. A very low score was initially obtained, demonstrating that
more and better feature engineering/preprocessing should be performed.
